# Face Registration Optimization Guide

## What We've Optimized

### 1. **Faster Model Loading**
- Models now preload when the app starts
- Progress indicator shows loading status
- Fallback to CDN if local models aren't available

### 2. **Quick Capture Mode**
- Reduced from 5 captures to 1-3 quick captures
- Smaller processing canvas (40% scale) for speed
- Higher confidence threshold (0.4) for better quality

### 3. **Better User Experience**
- Skip option available if models fail to load
- Real-time progress feedback
- Clear instructions and tips
- Visual loading indicators

### 4. **Performance Improvements**
- Optimized face detection parameters
- Reduced processing delays (50ms vs 200ms)
- Efficient descriptor validation
- Memory-conscious canvas operations

## Expected Performance

- **Before**: 10-15 seconds for face registration
- **After**: 2-5 seconds for face registration
- **Model Loading**: 1-3 seconds (happens in background)

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Good Lighting**: Ensure your face is well-lit
2. **Direct Gaze**: Look directly at the camera
3. **Stable Position**: Keep your face centered and still
4. **Clear Background**: Avoid busy backgrounds
5. **Close Distance**: Position yourself 1-2 feet from camera

## Troubleshooting

- If models fail to load, you can skip face registration
- Face registration can be completed later from your profile
- The system works without face registration (manual attendance)
- Clear browser cache if you experience issues
